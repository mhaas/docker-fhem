# Docker image for fhem on ARM devices #

I use this docker image on my Olimex A20-OLinuXIno-LIME2 with Debian Stretch.

This should also work on amdd64 and others, since the base image supports multiple
architectures.

If you build this, it is likely you will need to update the FHEM revision in
the Dockerfile.
